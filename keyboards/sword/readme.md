# Sword 1

[Sword](https://github.com/TheSciBoy/sword-alt)
This is a split ergonomic keyboard, customized for my personal hand
and with 6 thumb buttons on each hand and getting rid of the leftmost and rightmost columns
that most other mini-keyboards use instead.

* Keyboard Maintainer: [Daniel H.](https://github.com/TheSciBoy)
* Hardware Supported: Have not tested with anything except the KB2040

## Bootloader

Enter the bootloader by either:

* **Physical reset button**: Briefly press the button on the front of the PCB.
* **Keycode in layout**: Press the key mapped to `QK_BOOT` if it is available
